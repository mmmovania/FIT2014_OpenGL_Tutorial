                        OpenGL is the industry standard graphics API which is widely used both in the academic research as well as in the industry. This API has gone through numerous changes that have altered the way we program it. This hand on course introduces the audience to modern OpenGL v 4.4. We start with a gentle introduction to modern OpenGL. Then we look at the programmable graphics pipeline of the modern GPU. We then identify the four programmable shader stages i.e. the vertex, tessellation, geometry and fragment shaders. Each of these stages is explained with concrete use cases to ensure that the material covered is easily assimilated. Data manipulation through buffer objects, transform feedback mechanism as well as core graphics concepts like projection and camera model is also covered.
